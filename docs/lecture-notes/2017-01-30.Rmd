## Registered reports

- What are they?
- Why are they a thing?
- Who's doing them?
- How they work and how to get involved

## What are they?

## Why registered reports?

## Who's doing them?

- [Journals with Registered Reports](https://cos.io/rr/#journals) from COS

## How they work

- Google sheet comparing features <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D4_k-8C_UENTRtbPzXfhjEyu3BfLxdOsn9j-otrO870/edit#gid=0>

## How to get involved

- Study pre-registration separate from registered reports

## [RStudio](http://rstudio.com)

- An integrated development environment (IDE) for R

## Components of RStudio

- Code editor
- R console
- Integrated help
- Image viewer
- Integration with git and other version-control packages
- Project management

## RStudio in the cloud

- RStudio can be run in a browser from a server running RStudio Server
- [Demo](http://ec2-52-90-103-156.compute-1.amazonaws.com/)
    - Running this under Amazon Web Services (AWS) free tier
- Instructions for doing this yourself can be found [here](http://strimas.com/r/rstudio-cloud-1/)

## R Markdown

- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
    - Mark-up language to make it easy to write HTML
- R Markdown special type of Markdown
    - Allows for "literate" programming, mixing text, analysis, figures
    - Adds to Markdown syntax
    
## [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) syntax

- Text formatting
    + *italics* by surrounding text with single asterisks or underscores: `*italics*` or `_italics_`
    + **boldface** by surrounding text with double asterisks or underscores: `**boldface**` or `__boldface__`
    + ~~strikethrough~~ by surrounding text with double tildes: `~~strikethrough~~`
    + [Clickable URLs](http://www.psu.edu) by surrounding link text with square brackets and URL with parentheses: ```[Clickable URLs](http://www.psu.edu)```

## Markdown syntax

- Paragraph formatting
    + Headings with level specified by the number of hash (#) marks
    + Lists (bullet and enumerated)
    + Block quotes
    + Code blocks
    
----

```
# This is a Heading 1
## This is a Heading 2
### This is a Heading 3
```

----

- An item
    - A nested item
        - A doubly-nested item
- Another item

Code:
```
- An item
    - A nested item
        - A doubly-nested item
- Another item
```

----

1. An enumerated item
    - A nested item
1. A second enumerated item

Code:
```
1. An enumerated item
    - A nested item
1. A second enumerated item
```

Notice how the numbers are incremented automatically!

----

> Four score and seven years ago, some famous President spoke infamous words that would live on throughout history.
> These words are famous enough that I want to highlight them with a block quote.

```
> Four score and seven years ago, some famous President

## More on Markdown syntax

- Images can be inserted using this syntax `![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)`
- Comments -- won't print in rendered output -- `<!- This is a comment ->`

## R Markdown additions

- .Rmd extension
- Combine text, code, images, figures, video
- "Computable" reports, documents, slide shows, notebooks
- Output in multiple formats from the same file

## Make some data

```{r}
x = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)   # N(0,1)
y = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 2, sd = 0.5) # N(2, 0.5)
```

## Summary of x, y

```{r}
summary(x)
summary(y)
```

## Histogram of x

```{r}
hist(x)
```

## Histogram of y

```{r}
hist(y)
```

## Embed figure saved locally using HTML

`<img src="../img/my-img.jpg" height=500px>`

Height parameter (or, e.g. `width=800px`) is optional, but useful. Remember Markdown -> HTML.

----

<img src="../img/my-img.jpg" height=500px>

## Embed figure from the web 

`<img src="http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/content/wpvi/images/cms/280434_1280x720.jpg" width=900px>`

----

<img src="http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/content/wpvi/images/cms/280434_1280x720.jpg" width=900px>

## Embed YouTube video

`<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hUy9ePyo6Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>`

- YouTube gives you code to cut and paste.

----

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hUy9ePyo6Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Printing computed variables

```{r}
summ.x = summary(x)
summ.y = summary(y)
names(summ.x) # Figure out variable names for indexing
```

----

*Index by variable name:* X lies within the range of [`r summ.x["Min."]`, `r summ.x["Max."]`].

*Index by numeric index:* The (y-x) difference in means is ``r summ.y[4] - summ.x[4]``.

*Calculate and report:* The correlation between x and y is `r cor(x,y)`.
